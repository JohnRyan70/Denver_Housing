Mapping the Denver Housing Market (2014)

This project provides useful information for people wishing to explore and understand housing values in the Denver five-county area, during 2014 (the most recent data available). It offers insights at the neighborhood level - a difficult task - and then explores reasons why some neighborhoods have higher housing values than do others.

This project proceeds in four stages. The first stage is data gathering, preparation and wrangling. The second stage is data exploration and graphing. The third stage is predictive modeling using LASSO regression. The final stage is a Shiny app (using Leaflet) to let users explore the data on a Denver map.
