# The Denver Housing Market: or, Where Should I Move?

This project is designed to assess the Denver housing market. In particular, it highlights the highs and lows as well as analyzes the most influential factors upon housing values within the five-county area. By integrating the Census Bureau's American Community Survey and a separate source to assess school district quality, and using LASSO regression to reduce the effects of collinearity, the results provide a complex picture of the housing market.
